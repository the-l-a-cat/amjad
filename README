Names for functions.

lift        - send data to the front
ask       - send data back
store, load - communicate with database




Structure: Cell update log.
--------------------

A cell is itself a structure with a log, that is, a list of cell objects plus states and dates.

cell_memory -> list (cell)

cell -> ( blob - Arbitrary cell value. Redis string.
        , type - Excel type map.
        , grammar - Validation function.
        , date - Modification.
        , state - reserved
        , permissions - Bit field.
        )
    And how am I storing that in Redis?

A. On the client.
